### What is meant by scrum?
Scrum is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal. The framework begins with a simple premise: Start with what can be seen or known. After that, track the progress and tweak, as necessary.

### Scrum's Approach to Work
People are the focus of scrum. Scrum organizes projects using cross-functional teams, each one of which has all of the capabilities necessary to deliver a piece of functionality from idea to delivery. 

The scrum framework guides the creation of a product, focusing on value and high visibility of progress. Working from a dynamic list of the most valuable things to do, a team brings that product from an idea to life using the scrum framework as a guide for transparency, inspection, and adaptation. The goal of scrum is to help teams work together to delight your customers.

### The Scrum Team
A scrum team has three accountabilities (commonly known as roles):

- Developers - On a scrum team, a developer is anyone on the team that is delivering work, including those team members outside of software development. In fact, the 15th State of Agile Report found that the number of non-software teams adopting agile frameworks like scrum doubled from 2020 to 2021, with 27% reporting agile use in marketing, and between 10-16% reporting use in security, sales, finance, human resources, and more.
- Product Owner - Holds the vision for the product and prioritizes the product backlog
- Scrum Master - Helps the team best use scrum to build the product. 


### Scrum Artifacts
Scrum artifacts help manage the work: 

- Product Backlog - An emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product and includes the product goal.
- Sprint Backlog - The set of product backlog items selected for the sprint by the developers (team members), plus a plan for delivering the increment and realizing the sprint goal.
- Increment - A sum of usable sprint backlog items completed by the developers in the sprint that meets the definition of done, plus the value of all the increments that came before. Each increment is a recognizable, visibly improved, operating version of the product.

The team displays its plans and progress so that all team members and stakeholders can always see what the team is accomplishing. 


### Scrum Commitments
Each artifact has an associated commitment - not to be confused with one of the scrum values (covered below) - that ensures quality and keeps the team focused on delivering value to its users. 

- Definition of Done - When the increment is delivered, it needs to meet a shared understanding of what “done” means. The definition of done ensures that the standard of quality is met. The definition of done can differ between organizations and teams.
- Sprint Goal - A specific and singular purpose for the sprint backlog. This goal helps everyone focus on the essence of what needs to be done and why. 
- Product Goal - To plan the work to be done each sprint, teams need an idea of their product's overall objective. Each team may have multiple product goals over its lifetime, but only one at a time.

###  Sprint Burndown Charts
A sprint burndown (or burnup) chart is not an official scrum artifact but many teams use it to communicate and track progress toward the sprint goal during the sprint. (Related: The Trouble with Sprint Burndowns)

What is a sprint burndown chart? 
Sprint burndowns are a graphical way of showing how much work is remaining in the sprint, typically in terms of task hours. It is typically updated at the daily scrum. As the sprint progresses, the amount of work remaining should steadily decrease and should trend toward being complete on the last day of the sprint. Burndowns that show increasing work or few completed tasks are signals to the scrum master and the team that the sprint is not going well.

What is the purpose of the sprint burndown chart? 
Sprint burndown charts help teams gauge whether they will complete the work of a sprint. Burndown charts also reinforce the scrum values of commitment, focus, and openness and one of the three pillars of empirical process control: transparency.

### Scrum Events

Scrum teams work in sprints, each of which includes several events (or activities). Don't think of these events as meetings or ceremonies; the events that are contained within each sprint are valuable opportunities to inspect and adapt the product or the process (and sometimes both).

- The Sprint - The heartbeat of scrum. Each sprint should bring the product closer to the product goal and is a month or less in length. 
- Sprint Planning - The entire scrum team establishes the sprint goal, what can be done, and how the chosen work will be completed. Planning should be timeboxed to a maximum of 8 hours for a month-long sprint, with a shorter timebox for shorter sprints. 
- Daily Scrum - The developers (team members delivering the work) inspect the progress toward the sprint goal and adapt the sprint backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. A daily scrum should be timeboxed to 15 minutes each day. 
- Sprint Review - The entire scrum team inspects the sprint's outcome with stakeholders and determines future adaptations. Stakeholders are invited to provide feedback on the increment.
- Sprint Retrospective - The scrum team inspects how the last sprint went regarding individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and definition of done. The team identifies improvements to make the next sprint more effective and enjoyable. This is the conclusion of the sprint. 

### How It All Works Together
Scrum accountabilities, artifacts, and events work together within a sprint cycle. The product owner defines a vision using information from stakeholders and users. They identify and define pieces of value that can be delivered to move closer towards the product goal. Before the developers can work on any pieces of value, the product owner must order the backlog so that the team knows what is most important. The team can help the product owner further refine what needs to be done, and the product owner may rely on the developers to help them understand requirements and make trade-off decisions. (This is where refinement becomes an important tool for the scrum team.)

During sprint planning, the developers pull a chunk from the top of the product backlog and decide how they will complete it. The team has a set time frame, the sprint, to complete their work. They meet at the daily scrum to inspect progress towards the sprint goal and plan for the upcoming day. Along the way, the scrum master keeps the team focused on the sprint goal and can help the team improve as a whole. 

At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable and ready to be used by a user or shown to a stakeholder. After each sprint, the team conducts a sprint review on the Increment and a retrospective on the process. Then they choose the next chunk of the backlog and the cycle repeats.

Transitioning to an agile framework such as scrum requires a new mindset and overall cultural adjustments. And like all change, it doesn't come easy. But when teams and organizations fully commit to scrum, they'll discover a new sense of flexibility, creativity, and inspiration - all of which will lead to greater results.
